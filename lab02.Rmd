```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?
There Are 1852 chocolate bars rated
```{r cars}
dim(choc)
```

## How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.

```{r pressure}
count = c()
k = 1
for (i in 2006 : 2017) {
  count[k] = sum(choc$Review.Date == i)
  k = k+1
}

year = c(2006:2017)
y_data = cbind(year, count)

y_data = as.data.frame(y_data)


ggplot(y_data, aes(x = year)) + geom_bar(aes(weight=count))
```
